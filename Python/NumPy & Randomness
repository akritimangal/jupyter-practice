1. What NumPy Is (Mental Model)

NumPy is a numerical computing library designed for high-performance operations on arrays.

Key points:

Provides fast, fixed-type arrays

Operations are vectorized (no explicit Python loops)

Used for mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and simulations

import numpy as np

2. NumPy Array vs Python List
a = [1, 2, 3]            # Python list
b = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # NumPy array


Key differences:

Python lists allow mixed data types and are slower

NumPy arrays use a single data type and contiguous memory

NumPy operations are significantly faster for numerical work

3. Random Numbers — Core Idea

Random numbers in NumPy follow statistical distributions, not uncontrolled randomness.

Two fundamental distributions:

Uniform distribution

Normal (Gaussian) distribution

4. Uniform Distribution — np.random.rand()
np.random.rand(5)


Output:

[0.13 0.72 0.45 0.91 0.30]


Meaning:

Values lie in the range 0 ≤ x < 1

Every value in the range is equally likely

The range is fixed by definition

Changing the range:

5 + 2 * np.random.rand(5)


Output:

Values between 5 and 7

5. Normal Distribution — np.random.randn()
np.random.randn(5)


Output:

[ 0.2  -0.8   1.1  -0.4   0.05 ]


Meaning:

Mean = 0

Standard deviation = 1

Values cluster around the mean

No fixed bounds

6. Why Values Appear Between −1 and +1

This behavior is probabilistic, not a hard limit.

Statistical rule for a normal distribution:

~68% of values lie within ±1σ

~95% lie within ±2σ

~99.7% lie within ±3σ

Extreme values are rare but possible.

7. Custom Distributions

Uniform distribution with custom range:

np.random.uniform(5, 10, 5)


Output:

Values between 5 and 10


Normal distribution with custom parameters:

np.random.normal(10, 2, 5)


Output:

Values clustered around 10 with spread 2

8. Random Integers
np.random.randint(0, 10, size=5)


Output:

[3 7 1 9 0]


Notes:

Lower bound is inclusive

Upper bound is exclusive

9. Sampling — choice()
np.random.choice([10, 20, 30])


Output:

20


Sampling with probabilities:

np.random.choice([0, 1], p=[0.7, 0.3], size=5)


Output:

[0 1 0 0 0]

10. Shuffle vs Permutation
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
np.random.shuffle(a)


Effect:

Modifies the original array in place

np.random.permutation(a)


Effect:

Returns a shuffled copy

Original array remains unchanged

11. Seed — Reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)
np.random.rand(3)


Effect:

Produces the same output every run

Important:

Seeding does not remove randomness

It fixes the random sequence for reproducibility

12. Visual Interpretation

Uniform distribution → flat histogram

Normal distribution → bell-shaped curve

Patterns become visible only with large samples

13. Final Mental Model

rand() → fixed range, flat probability

randn() → center-focused probability

Distributions describe how frequently values occur

NumPy directly implements statistical laws

14. One-Line Takeaway

NumPy randomness is structured, not arbitrary — it follows precise statistical rules that model real-world uncertainty.

NumPy Shapes: (5,) vs (1,5)
15. Shape Meaning
(5,)

One-dimensional array

Five values

No rows or columns

Visual:

[ a  b  c  d  e ]

(1,5)

Two-dimensional array

One row, five columns

Visual:

[ a  b  c  d  e ]

16. Core Difference
Shape	Meaning
(5,)	Values only
(1,5)	One-row table

Same values, different structure.

17. Transpose Behavior
np.array([1, 2, 3]).T


Output:

[1 2 3]

np.array([[1, 2, 3]]).T


Output:

[[1]
 [2]
 [3]]

18. Why NumPy Treats Them Differently

NumPy follows matrix mathematics

Rows and columns must be explicit

(5,) has no direction

(1,5) has a defined row direction

19. When to Use Which

Use (5,) when:

Performing simple vector operations

Computing dot products

Working with temporary numeric data

Use (1,5) when:

Working with machine learning features

Performing matrix operations

Explicit row structure is required

20. Memory Rule

One number in the shape means a 1D array.
Two numbers in the shape mean rows × columns.
